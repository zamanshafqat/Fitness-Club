#How to run the program
//To Run My GUI
Download the latest JavaFX sdk from
https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/
.
java --module-path "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib" --add-modules
javafx.controls,javafx.fxml rw.app.Main
I executed this in finalprojectgui\target\classes folder after building my project.
Your --module-path will be different than mine. I downloaded the latest JavaFX sdk from
https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ for Windows (my OS) and installed it. Then I used the
location of installation "C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-sdk-21.0.1\lib" to run my program.
